# Welcome to the Github Readme!

This thing will be included on the downloads but you should read the .txt instead there

Because .txt just works when you are outside Github

I haven't tested it though...


## Steps to play Game:
1. Go to ConsoleApp2.exe
2. Click it or Double-Click it
3. If nothing happens, wait a bit and if there's nothing,
Then you probably have another Operating System, 
Check Below for your Specific Operating System

## Operating System Compatablity

### Terms:

OS - Operating Systems

Yes - Confirmed Working

Maybe - Haven't tested, send me reports if you have any other OS that works or not

No - Confirmed not Working (Might create a version that works with the OS in here.)

### Actual OS:
Windows: Yes

Linux: Maybe

MacOS or OSX: Maybe

Unix Variants: Maybe

BSD and its Variants: Maybe

## Notes:

You might have a version that works for you if i work on this more

So no problems!

Although i might be busy so sorry if i can't develop this further into a real app.

Every OS has a Console or Terminal but theu run differently and that means different code.

So if you are waiting for your version for your OS, it might be actually getting developed!

Also, you might have to install another app to get this working but don't worry!

I will be trying to make the base OS work with this app. 

But, no promises, i might have to do that to make it work so yeah.

Thats it!
