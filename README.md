### Note: Net 6.0 works but textwars 2.0 is the version, NOT 1.0, i will keep the old version for archive reasons.
You might have noticed that i changed this from not compatible to this, which is because i made a version for net 6.0, i had to rewrite it because i lost the source code files and i uploaded the application not the source code. Now as for the old source code its bascially just the net 5.0 version but in here instead of packages lol. If you have net 5.0, **Update Now!**, i am porting all of my stuff to net 6.0 in the future and you might miss out on new updates.

### BTW: .txt barely updates because i am lazy

This thing will be included on the downloads but you should read the .txt instead there

Because .txt just works when you are outside Github
