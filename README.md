# Note: Net 6.0 works but textwars 2.0 is the version, NOT 1.0, i will keep the old version for archive reasons.

You might have noticed that i changed this from not compatible to this, which is because i made a version for net 6.0, i had to rewrite it because i lost the source code files and i uploaded the application not the source code. Now as for the old source code its bascially just the net 5.0 version but in here instead of packages lol. If you have net 5.0, **Update Now!**, i am porting all of my stuff to net 6.0 in the future and you might miss out on new updates.

# Welcome to the Github Readme!
## BTW: .txt barely updates because i am lazy 

This thing will be included on the downloads but you should read the .txt instead there

Because .txt just works when you are outside Github


## Steps to play Game:
1. Go to ConsoleApp2.exe
2. Click it or Double-Click it
3. If nothing happens, wait a bit and if there's nothing,
Then you probably have another Operating System, 
Check Below for your Specific Operating System

## Operating System Compatablity

### Terms:

Note: You need dotnet to run the app anyway

OS - Operating Systems

Yes - Confirmed Working

Maybe - Haven't tested, send me reports if you have any other OS that works or not

No - Confirmed not Working (Might create a version that works with the OS in here.)

### Actual OS:
Windows: Yes

Linux: Maybe

MacOS or OSX: Maybe

Unix Variants: No?

BSD and its Variants: No?

## Notes:

You might have a version that works for you if i work on this more

So no problems!

Although i might be busy so sorry if i can't develop this further into a real app.

Every OS has a Console or Terminal but theu run differently and that means different code.

So if you are waiting for your version for your OS, it might be actually getting developed!

Also, you might have to install another app to get this working but don't worry!

I will be trying to make the base OS work with this app. 

But, no promises, i might have to do that to make it work so yeah.

BTW, for GitHub People, the .gitignore is exclusively here and can't be ported to the main download

Thats it!
